------------

* What can I do with Rainbow? 

With Rainbow you can easily draw graphics (interactive or not) in your Android application.

* How to do it?

Import it on your **build.gradle**
```
repositories {
    maven {
	    url "https://jitpack.io"
    }
}

dependencies {
    compile 'com.github.juankysoriano:rainbow:v1.0.0-rc5'
}
```

Once done it is very easy to integrate! Just extend `Rainbow` and attach it to one of your `ViewGroup`! Then you will `@Override` the methods in the `RainbowLifeCycleCallback` to control your animations. ([Check the demo app!!][2])

Something like this:

1 ) _Creating a `Rainbow` object_:

```java
public class RainbowSketch extends Rainbow {

    private static final int FRAME_RATE = 60;
    protected RainbowSketch(ViewGroup parentView) {
        super(parentView);
    }

    public void onSketchSetup() {
      //Called when the rainbow is being setup.
      frameRate(FRAME_RATE);
    }

    public void onDrawingStart() {
      //Called when the rainbow sketch is about to start.
    }

    public void onDrawingResume() {
       //Called when the rainbow sketch is resumed
    }

    public void onDrawingStep() {
       //Called when the rainbow sketch is about to perform a new step
       //Here is where the animations should be done.
       
       //This will be called a FRAME_RATE number of times per second!!! 
       //GREAT and ASYNCHRONOUS!!
    }

    public void onDrawingPause() {
       //Called when the rainbow sketch is about to pause
    }

    public void onDrawingStop() {
        //Called when the rainbow sketch is about to stop
    }

    public void onSketchDestroy() {
        //Called when the rainbow sketch is about to be destroyed
    }
}
```

2 ) _What is a `RainbowDrawer`?_ 

A `RainbowDrawer` exposes to you all the methods you will need in order to do amazing drawings. Following one example.

```java
    public void onDrawingStep() {
       //Let's retrieve a RainbowDrawer object (for painting).
       RainbowDrawer rainbowDrawer = getRainbowDrawer();
        
       //Let's setup our paint-style
       rainbowDrawer.fill(Color.RED);
       rainbowDrawer.strokeWeight(2);
       rainbowDrawer.stroke(Color.BLUE);
       
       //Let's paint something!
       
       // A quarter screen rectangle
       rainbowDrawer.rect(0, 
                          0, 
                          getWidth()/2, 
                          getHeight()/2); 
       
       // A quarter screen ellipse
       rainbowDrawer.ellipse(getWidth()/2, 
                            getHeight()/2, 
                            getWidth()/2, 
                            getHeight()/2);  
    }
```

Try to compilate it a bit! 

3 ) _What is a `RainbowInputController` ?_

With `RainbowInputController` you have access to the user interactions with your `Rainbow`

```java
    public void onDrawingStep() {
        //Let's retrieve a RainbowDrawer object (for painting).
        RainbowDrawer rainbowDrawer = getRainbowDrawer();
        //Let's setup our paint-style
        rainbowDrawer.fill(Color.RED);
        rainbowDrawer.strokeWeight(2);
        rainbowDrawer.stroke(Color.BLUE);
       
        //Lets's retrieve a RainbowInputController (for controlling). 
        RainbowInputController rainbowInputController = getRainbowInputController();
        //Let's paint something
        rainbowDrawer.ellipse(rainbowInputController.getX(), 
                            rainbowInputController.getY(), 
                            100, 
       	                    100);
    }
```

You can also register to it a `RainbowInteractionListener` for more fine grained control over the user interactions.

```java
public interface RainbowInteractionListener {
    void onSketchTouched(final MotionEvent event, 
                        final RainbowDrawer rainbowDrawer);

    void onSketchReleased(final MotionEvent event, 
                        final RainbowDrawer rainbowDrawer);

    void onFingerDragged(final MotionEvent event, 
                        final RainbowDrawer rainbowDrawer);

    void onMotionEvent(final MotionEvent event, 
                        final RainbowDrawer rainbowDrawer);
}
```

4 . _Let's inject a `Rainbow` into your `ViewGroup`_

```java
public class SketchActivity extends Activity {

    private RainbowSketch sketch;
    private ViewGroup sketchView;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.sketch);
        sketchView = getSketchView();
        sketch = new RainbowSketch(sketchView);
    }

    private ViewGroup getSketchView() {
        return (ViewGroup) findViewById(R.id.rainbow_layout);
    }

    @Override
    public void onPause() {
        sketch.pause();
        super.onPause();
    }

    @Override
    public void onStart() {
        super.onStart();
        sketch.start();
    }

    @Override
    public void onResume() {
        super.onResume();
        sketch.resume();
    }

    @Override
    public void onStop() {
        sketch.stop();
        super.onStop();
    }

    @Override
    public void onDestroy() {
        sketch.destroy();
        sketch = null;
        super.onDestroy();
    }
```

Proguard
--------

As rainbow uses third party libraries for now you would have to include this into your proguard properties:

```
-dontwarn com.squareup.picasso.**
-dontwarn com.squareup.okhttp.**
```
